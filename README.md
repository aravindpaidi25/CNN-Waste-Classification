CNN Convolution Neural Network
# Week-1
This project develops a CNN model to classify images of plastic waste into categories like bottles, bags, and foam. By automating waste sorting, the model aids recycling efforts, making the process faster and more accurate. It uses a labeled dataset, image preprocessing, and training to optimize performance for efficient waste management.
